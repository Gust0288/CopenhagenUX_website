      text="The theme for UX Copenhagen 2024 is: Degrowth and Consumerism. Angelos Arnis, the closing keynote for UX Copenhagen 2023 stated very bluntly “There is no planet B”. For far too long, we have been living in a world that applauds and encourages continuous growth, expansion, selling, and manipulation. It’s a world of over production and over consumption, but we’re running out of resources. Business as usual will not cut it anymore. On March 20-21, 2024, we’ll be discussing climate change, consumerism, and waste. We’ll talk about degrowth, and about unlearning decades of harmful production, development and processes. We’ll have talks about how consumerism will need to change in order for the planet to survive."

These conversations will be hosted by Helle Martens, as they are inspired by her initial chats with potential speakers for the UX Copenhagen Conference. She will be inviting potential speakers, and voices in tech and design to talk about the upcoming theme for the next conference, about ethics in design and tech, and about everything in between. Every conversation is recorded live, and anyone can join in with questions during the event."
